This project is a comprehensive home lab environment designed to simulate real-world IT Support and System Administration tasks following ITSM practices. It demonstrates the end-to-end setup, configuration, and management of an enterprise-like IT infrastructure, with a strong focus on identity management, security, automation, and troubleshooting.
Welcome to my comprehensive IT infrastructure project, where I have meticulously designed and implemented a home lab environment integrating Active Directory solutions, both on-premises and in the cloud through Azure Active Directory. This project highlights my proficiency in deploying and managing complex IT systems, utilizing a range of tools and skills to ensure robust operational capabilities.
This project not only showcases my technical expertise in IT infrastructure management but also underscores my ability to design, deploy, and optimize enterprise-grade solutions. It reflects my commitment to excellence in IT service delivery and my readiness to contribute effectively to organizational IT operation.
